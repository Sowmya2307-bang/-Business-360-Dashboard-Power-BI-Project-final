📘 About This Project
I learned and built this project entirely through self-practice after completing the Power BI 3.0 course by Codebasics. I explored every feature, formula, and visual with full depth—learning every inch of the tool hands-on. This project reflects my deep understanding of Power BI, from raw data to impactful storytelling.
