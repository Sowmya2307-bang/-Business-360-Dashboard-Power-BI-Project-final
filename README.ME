## 💡 What I Learned

This project was completed entirely through self-learning and practice after finishing the **Power BI Data Analytics 3.0** course from Codebasics.

I explored every feature hands-on—relationships, DAX, visuals, formatting, and storytelling—and **learned each and every inch of it independently**.
